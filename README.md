# End-to-End Data Pipeline & Interactive Visualization

This repository contains an end-to-end data project that demonstrates how to:

1. Collect data from the web
2. Clean and preprocess the raw data
3. Explore and analyze the dataset
4. Build interactive visualizations using Altair and Vega-Lite

The project highlights a modern, reproducible data workflow that goes from raw web data to interactive, insight-driven visualizations.

## 🔁 Project Workflow

The project follows this pipeline:

**Web Scraping → Data Cleaning → Exploratory Analysis → Interactive Visualization**

| Step | File | Description |
|------|------|------------|
| Scraping | `brewery_data_scrape.ipynb` | Collects raw brewery data from a public website |
| Cleaning | `cleaned.csv` | Cleaned and structured version of the raw data |
| Visualization | `interactive_visualization_altair_vegalite.ipynb` | Interactive charts and dashboards |

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how interactive visualization can be used not only for presentation, but as a core part of the analytical process. By combining data collection, transformation, and visualization in one pipeline, the project shows how raw data can be transformed into interpretable insights.

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains information about breweries in the United States, including location, brewery type, and other attributes scraped from a public data source. The raw data is collected via web scraping and then cleaned before being used for analysis and visualization.
